Pour the egg sauce over the sautéed onions in the pan. Allow it to cook until the eggs are partially set. Place the cooked tonkatsu on top of steamed rice in a bowl. Pour the partially set egg sauce and onions over the tonkatsu and rice. Cover the bowl with a lid or foil and let it sit for a few minutes to allow the residual heat to finish cooking the eggs. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious Katsudon!</p>
